Feature Selection for Stock Trading using Extra Trees Classifier
This Python code is designed to perform feature selection on financial and macroeconomic data for multiple stock tickers, and save the resulting feature importances to a CSV file.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
ta
sklearn


How to Use
Ensure that the required libraries are installed
Replace the stock_data.csv and macro_data.csv files with actual stock and macroeconomic data files
Modify the tickers list to include the desired stock tickers
Run the script
The code will iterate through the tickers in the tickers list, perform feature selection using an Extra Trees Classifier, and append the resulting feature importances to a list called all_results. Once all tickers have been processed, the code will save the feature importances to a CSV file called feature_importances.csv.

Code Details
The main function in the code is feature_selection, which takes in a stock ticker, a DataFrame of stock data, and a DataFrame of macroeconomic data. The function performs feature selection on the combined data using an Extra Trees Classifier, and returns a list of feature importances.

The tickers list is used to iterate through each stock ticker and call the feature_selection function. The resulting feature importances are appended to a list called all_results, which is then used to create a DataFrame of feature importances. Finally, the feature importances are written to a CSV file called feature_importances.csv.

Future Improvements
This code could be further improved in several ways, including:

Adding more feature selection algorithms to compare results (e.g. Random Forest, LASSO)
Adding more macroeconomic data to the analysis
Using the feature importances to select a subset of features for a machine learning model
Adding more detailed comments and documentation for improved readability and usability
Overall, this code provides a useful starting point for feature selection in stock trading, and can be customized and extended as needed to suit specific requirements.
